# karishev.github.io

The website created to represent the 30 MFF shooted suring the class. My team made a film about thinking about the ideas how to shoot the film, while being presented as an object in our room. I made a website of the company that made that film and decided to present it. You can think about it as leaf website of the main company website. It contains sections: Film, Cast, and Behind the scenes. 


I had no prior experience in html, css or javascript, so everything was hard for me. I started with a wireframe, which I thought would be a good website to create.
[Wireframe 27.05.pdf](https://github.com/karishev/karishev.github.io/files/6591412/Wireframe.27.05.pdf)


I started to make the website, using the help of stackoverflow and w3schools. This is the result that I got after two days.

At first I had the same colors as in my wireframe, but then I decided to change them with some photos, which wasn't the best idea. In the website you had the hamburger navigation bar, that opens if you click on it. In the navigation bar, you can click on the sections that will scroll to chose place.

However, I didn't like the idea and some of my friends said that the design and the fonts were looking ugly. This was the turning point and I decided to create a <a href = "https:/karishev.github.io"> new website </a> from the beginning. It was easier, because I already had some experience with the first website, but stil many things were unknown to me. The thing that really helped me was looking at other websites, their design, their codes. For the last week, my 'favorite' thing to do was inspecting the websites and thinking how to implement things. Because of this, I also decided to make everything minimalistic and leave the background as white and font as black. This could also lead to change of the theme to dark, but I didn't implement it, because of the time limit and the way I decide to change the margin of the body, so it is harder to adjust everything.

I think, keeping everything simple was a good decision, I thik the website doesn't look as ugly as the previous one. I added some features in script, but most of my 'innovation' are commented in the document. There was always a problem with some lines, so I decided to not waste time on them. In addition, I think the website is looking okay on mobile, with some exceptions, like the sections. I made the height of sections as 100vh, so it adjusts with the height ofthe phone, leaving a half a page white blank. Even with this, because I had no prior experience and two classes this semester, I was going to bed at 6-8 am in the morning and waking up at 12pm to get everything done. In my opinion, it was more because of my stubborness and the idea of learning something new. It is strange now that my youtube recommendations are about css and html. 

I really liked the assignment, new coding experience is always interesting. It was hard with the creativity assignment, because I didn't know what 'innovative' to put, so I have just added sarcastic cast comments, reviews and made an instagram page of the company <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/xo_production1/" > here </a>
