The website created to represent the 30 MFF shooted suring the class. My team made a film about thinking about the ideas how to shoot the film, while being presented as an object in our room. 


I had no prior experience in html, css or javascript, so everything was hard for me. I started with a wireframe, which I thought would be a good website to create.
[Wireframe 27.05.pdf](https://github.com/karishev/karishev.github.io/files/6591412/Wireframe.27.05.pdf)


I started to make the website, using the help of stackoverflow and w3schools websites. This is the result that I got after two days.

At first I had the same colors as in my wireframe, but then I decided to change them with some photos, which wasn't the best idea. In the website you had the hamburger navigation bar, that opens if you click on it. In the navigation bar, you can click on the sections that will scroll to chose place.
