The website created to represent the 30 MFF shooted suring the class. My team made a film about thinking about the ideas how to shoot the film, while being presented as an object in our room. 


I had no prior experience in html, css or javascript, so everything was hard for me. I started with a wireframe, which I thought would be a good website to create.
